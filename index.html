	<h1>The Lord of the Rings</h1>
		<p>
		His most famous work is undoubtedly "The Lord of the Rings", divided into three volumes: "the Fellowship of the Ring", "The Two Towers", "The Return of the King".
		</p>
	<h2> The Fellowship of the Ring</h2>
		<p>
		The future of civilization rests in the fate of the One Ring, which has been lost for centuries. Powerful forces are unrelenting in their search for it. But fate has placed it in the hands of a young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins , who inherits the Ring and steps into legend. A daunting task lies ahead for Frodo when he becomes the Ringbearer - to destroy the One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom where it was forged.
		This volume was adapted for cinema in 2001. 
		</p>
 	<h2> The Two Towers</h2>
 		<p>
 		"The Two Towers" follows the continuing quest of Frodo and the Fellowship to destroy the One Ring. Frodo and Sam discover they are being followed by the mysterious Gollum. Aragorn , the Elf archer Legolas and Gimli the Dwarf encounter the besieged Rohan kingdom, whose once great King Theoden has fallen under Saruman's deadly spell.
 		This volume was adapted for cinema in 2002.
 		</p>

 	<h2>The Return of te King</h2>
 		<p>
 		"The Return of the King" presents the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil fighting for control of the future of Middle-earth. Hobbits Frodo and Sam reach Mordor in their quest to destroy the `one ring', while Aragorn leads the forces of good against Sauron's evil army at the stone city of Minas Tirith.
 		This volume was adapted for cinema in 2003.
 		</p>

 <h1>The Hobbit</h1>
 	<p>
 	Although it was published and written before "The Lord of the Rings, the work "The Hobbit" is less popular than the lord of the rings, because more recently adapted to the cinema.
	 </p>
	 <h2>The Hobbit</h2>
	 <p>
	 	Bilbo Baggins lives a simple life with his fellow hobbits in the shire, until the wizard Gandalf arrives and convinces him to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim the kingdom of Erebor. The journey takes Bilbo on a path through treacherous lands swarming with orcs, goblins and other dangers, not the least of which is an encounter with Gollum and a simple gold ring that is tied to the fate of Middle Earth in ways Bilbo cannot even fathom.
	 	This work was adapted to the cinema in three different movies: "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey", "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug", and finally "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies".
